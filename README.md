A project to create a phx.gen.llm scaffold builder similar to auth to help create llm based phoenix apps.

#

The inspiration for this project was, after creating an LLM based app for the 4th time the steps and major components were rather repetitive. 

Since these types of projects will have a lot of commonality but also vary widely, I believe the project should currently focus on generators creating code that will live in the project instead of a separate library that will be much harder for a user to take and make into what they need.
